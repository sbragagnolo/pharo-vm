A SimulatorEventTransformer takes events as wrapped by HandMorph and converts them to a form a StackInterpreterSimulator can deal with.

See HandMorph >> handleEvent to see what the wrapping entails.
See HandMorph >> ProcessEvents  or EventSensor >> fetchMoreEvents for examples of what an unwrapped event looks like when given to the system for pre-wrapping.
