calling convention
numRegArgs
	"Define how many register arguments a StackToRegisterMappingCogit can
	 and should use with the receiver.  The value must be 0, 1 or 2.  Note that a
	 SimpleStackBasedCogit always has 0 register args (although the receiver is
	 passed in a register).  CogObjectRepresentationForSqueakV3 only implements
	 at most 1-arg primitives, because the complexity of the object representation
	 makes it difficult to implement at:put:, the most performance-critical 2-argument
	 primitive..  The method must be inlined in CoInterpreter, and dead code eliminated
	 so that the register-popping enilopmarts such as enterRegisterArgCogMethod:-
	 at:receiver: do not have to be implemented in SimpleStackBasedCogit."
