class table puns
firstClassIndexPun
	"Class puns are class indices not used by any class.  There is an entry
	 for the pun that refers to the notional class of objects with this class
	 index.  But because the index doesn't match the class it won't show up
	 in allInstances, hence hiding the object with a pun as its class index.
	 The puns occupy indices 16 through 31."
