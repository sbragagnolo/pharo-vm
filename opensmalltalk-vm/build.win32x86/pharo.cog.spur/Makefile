# NOTES: 
# STACK_ALIGN_BYTES=16 is needed in mingw and FFI (and I suppose on other modules too).
# ALLOCA_LIES_SO_USE_GETSP=0 Some compilers return the stack address+4 on alloca function, 
# then FFI module needs to adjust that. It is NOT the case of mingw.
# For more information see this thread: http://forum.world.st/There-are-something-fishy-with-FFI-plugin-td4584226.html
