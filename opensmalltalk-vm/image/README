This directory contains scripts that can build various VMMaker and Spur images.
As of late 2015 the default VMMaker build script is
	buildspurtrunkvmmakerimage.sh
and it builds a Spur VMMaker image, called SpurVMMaker.image.
The buildspurtrunkreader.sh script builds a Spur image containing a simple REPL
that is convenient for testing in the simulator, called spurreader.image.

buildspurtrunk64image.sh takes a Spur 32-bit image and morphs it into a 64-bit image.
